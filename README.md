# Organise AIâœ¨

This program allows you to organise your files based on any criteria you want.

### Example

Sorting files based on project.

Files with similar properties based on context from various sources such as file name, metadata, file extension will be groups together.

`funkybass.wav` and `funkysong.flp` would go in the same folder because we can tell that they likely belong together.
